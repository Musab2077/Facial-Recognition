## Face Lock (Facial Recognition)
Facial Recognition ðŸ˜ƒ by Siamese Neural Netowrk using Tensorflow.

## Siamese Neural Network

It is an article paper on differentiating two types of images (i.e positive and negative) by passing an anchor image. This model  is trained on positive data which will be your facial images. Negative data are just random images. The model includes a distant layer which helps to differentiate. 

More over you can read a detail documentation on [Siamese Neural Network](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf). I hope you will find it interesting.
